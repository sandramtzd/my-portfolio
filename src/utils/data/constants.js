    about: 
        "My journey into tech has been unconventional. Originally a chemical engineer, I witnessed firsthand the industry's struggle with data mismanagement and time-consuming administrative tasks. Fueled by the desire to bridge this gap, I seized the opportunity to transition into tech. Awarded the British Council Scholarship for Women in STEM, I embarked on a transformative Master's journey, complemented by an intensive 3-month full-stack development bootcamp. Now, armed with a Master's in Information Technology and a specialization in Business Intelligence, I'm on a mission to revolutionize industries by crafting data-driven strategies and innovative software solutions. Let's turn challenges into opportunities together! "
